# Big Data Project Architecture Overview

This document outlines the architecture of our Big Data project, detailing the flow from data ingestion to insights generation.

## Architecture Diagram

The architecture diagram (image.png) illustrates the flow of data through various components including cloud storage, processing engines, and databases.

## Steps

### Step 1: Data Ingestion

- **S3 Bucket**: Raw data is ingested into an AWS S3 bucket. This is the starting point for our data pipeline.

### Step 2: Data Cleaning

- **Python**: Data cleaning and preprocessing are performed using Python scripts. The cleaned data is stored back into an S3 bucket for further processing.

### Step 3: Data Processing

- **PySpark**: The cleaned data is processed using PySpark, which is a Python API for Apache Spark. This step involves heavy-duty processing like transformations and aggregations.

### Step 4: Data Storage

- **Parquet**: After processing, data is stored in Parquet format, which is a columnar storage file format optimized for use with big data processing tools.

### Step 5: Loading to Data Warehouse

- **Apache Sqoop**: We use Apache Sqoop to transfer data from the S3 bucket to our Data Warehouse in RDS (Relational Database Service).

### Step 6: Data Warehouse

- **RDS**: Inside the RDS, data is stored in a normalized database with dimension (Dim) and fact (Fact) tables, which is a typical schema for data warehouses.

### Step 7: Reporting

- **Python**: We use Python again to generate reports from the data stored in RDS. These reports are designed to provide actionable insights and support business decisions.

### Step 8: Insights Generation

- **Insights**: The final step in our data pipeline is the generation of insights, which are derived from the processed data and reports.

## How to Use This Project

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have AWS credentials configured to access S3 buckets and RDS instances.
2. Install Python with necessary libraries like `boto3` for AWS interaction and `pyspark` for data processing.
3. Install Apache Sqoop for transferring data between Hadoop and relational databases.
4. Run the Python scripts for data cleaning.
5. Process the data with PySpark as per the project requirements.
6. Use Sqoop to transfer processed data to the data warehouse.
7. Generate reports and insights using Python scripts.

## Requirements

- AWS account with access to S3, RDS, and necessary permissions.
- Python 3.x with `boto3`, `pyspark`, and other relevant libraries.
- Apache Spark and Sqoop installed on your system or in a cloud environment.
- Knowledge of SQL for querying the data warehouse.
